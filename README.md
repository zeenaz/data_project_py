# data_project_py

data project for 2021 used python, repo
if I couldn't solve it now, do it another day.

okay, here's some idea about this project:

when I checking the website

it's a bad picture for me, I can't understand those "random" numbers form the gov data report
so, I wanted to transfer the "postcode" into geographic shapes
kind of like this

plus the next graph

I also wanted to show the trends of covid like this:

I checked the data, then I realized I can categorize them into [overseas] [locally](Locally acquired - linked to known case or cluster)
I found a category called _unknow_local_ **Locally acquired - no links to known case or cluster**

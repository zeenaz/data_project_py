# data_project_py

data project for 2021 used python, repo
if I couldn't solve it now, do it another day.

okay, here's some idea about this project:

when I checking the website

it's a bad picture for me, I can't understand those "random" numbers form the gov data report
so, I wanted to transfer the "postcode" into geographic shapes
kind of like this

plus the next graph

I also wanted to show the trends of covid like this:

I checked the data, then I realized I can categorize them into **Overseas**, **Locally** -- _(Locally acquired - linked to known case or cluster)_, and **unknow_local** -- _(Locally acquired - no links to known case or cluster)_

Here are some TODOs:

1. clean the data, try to fix the missing data error - try to identify as **unclear**
2. link the _postcode_ number with the map
3. figure out the relation between color's _shade_ and the infected _number_
   ...

Here are some questions;

1. how to display oversea lines?
2. how to display known local lines?
